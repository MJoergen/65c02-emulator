# cpu6502
This is going to be a very simple 6502 emulator. The aim is only to obey the
semantics of the instructions. There is no concept of clock cycles, and the
memory is assumed to be infinitely fast.

TODO: Almost all instructions are implemented, and there are still
a few bugs left that are reported by the 6502 functional test suite.
